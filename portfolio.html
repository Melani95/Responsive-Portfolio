          Hello! My name is Kiana Melani Nacua. My mother full Samoan and my father is native Haiwaiian. I was born in Orange County and am currently still a resident. I have three brothers and two younger sisters. I'm the middle child but could always be described as motherly. 
          I began college while still in high school as a biomedical engineering major. I also began my first two jobs as a medical assistant at an urgent care and working in City Hall for congressman Dr. Ruiz. 
          After years of working for the congressman, attending school and holding part-time jobs, I completed a scholarship pageant program for the city of San Jacinto. I then made the choice to explore new cities and opportunities.

          Thankfully, those decisions were fruitful. I moved to Los Angeles where I was assisting in realty management. I made lifelong friends and connections there which led me to the administration and marketing title I currently hold.
          Working with company's such as Nordstrom, Disney and Louis Vuitton have been eye-opening experiences. The level of detail and diligent effort by their teams are inspiring and a privelege to work beside.

       My current goal is to continue growing in the feild I'm in. In my free time I always hold part-time jobs as a means of entertainment, extra income and for learning purposes. 
       I currently have two extra incomes to include working as a server at a nightclub and modeling.
